    /// unconditionally) because it kept no per-peer state and healed packet loss by simply
    /// sending again. The byte was never the cost: a section pays framing (a node header,
    /// and a group header when it opens one), so an idle node paid 2 to 10 bytes per peer
    /// every 100 ms as a permanent floor that scaled with scene count, not activity. The ack
    /// ring (<see cref="SentNodeRing"/>) now routes acks to exactly the nodes in a packet, so

    /// <c>clientHasInterest</c> starts true. A respawn resets the server side through

    /// <para><b>Detection.</b> Interest is evaluated on the node's stagger slot (once per
    /// <see cref="SYNC_INTERVAL"/> ticks, as before) by comparing the computed
    /// <c>IsPeerInterested</c> against the value the peer provably holds - not by listening
